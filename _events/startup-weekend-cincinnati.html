<p>Startup Weekend is a 54 hour event that brings together Cincinnati designers, developers, entrepreneurs, and experts from all domains to do amazing things.</p><p>All Startup Weekend events follow the same basic model: anyone is welcome to pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams form around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote) and embark on a three-day frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing, and market validation. The weekend culminates with presentations in front of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback!ï»¿</p>
