<p>Founded in Cincinnati in 2009, Paper Acorn began as a creative outlet for artist Jessica Wolf. While learning the ins &amp; outs of structural engineering at her full-time job in the package design industry, Wolf was inspired to create more than toothpaste cartons and dog food bags.</p><p>After hours, with ruler and X-acto knife in hand, she set to work creating something of her own. An intricate box crafted from scraps of paperboard formed the shape of a tiny forest treasure; a humble acorn.&nbsp;Excited about the possibilities, she continued to create in her free time and many other designs quickly followed.</p><p>An online store&nbsp;was opened to test the waters of potential revenue. After some promising successes, the pull to dedicate more time to growing her business called her out of a full time position and into the life of self-employment.</p><p>The naming of her business came naturally; noting her primary medium and harkening back to the little nut that sparked this journey,&nbsp;<strong>Paper Acorn</strong>&nbsp;began to sprout roots. </p><p>Inspired by the endless possibilities of paper and the imaginations of her customers, Jessica continues to expand her line of products in the wedding &amp; party, home décor, and DIY crafting industries.﻿</p>
