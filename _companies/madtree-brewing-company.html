<p>Cincinnati’s
MadTree Brewing made history when they opened in 2013 by becoming the first
modern craft brewery to can its beer in Ohio. They are currently constructing a
new $18M brewery in Cincinnati’s Oakley neighborhood set to open Winter 2016/2017.
MadTree is known for focusing more on great tasting beers rather than following
traditional brewing style guidelines. Their award-winning beers are distributed
throughout Cincinnati, Dayton, Columbus, Toledo, Athens and Northern Kentucky.
