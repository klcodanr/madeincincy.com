<p><strong>Fibonacci Brewing Company</strong>&nbsp;is a nanobrewery that produces high quality craft beers in a laid back, casual environment in Mt Healthy, Ohio. Our entire craft beer lineup is available for consumption on site, while growlers to go is subject to availability. We produce a wide variety of craft beers, concentrating on non-traditional and hybrid beer styles, that appeal to all beer drinkers ranging from casual beer drinkers to the beer connoisseur.</p>
<p>So what exactly is &ldquo;Fibonacci&rdquo; and why was this chosen as the name of our brewery? Fibonacci is most closely association with a mathematical concept known as the Fibonacci Sequence. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The name Fibonacci was chosen for the brewery for multiple reasons. First, co-founder Bob Bollas has a deep passion for mathematics in general, as well as computer science specifically and co-founder Betty Bollas is obsessed with horticulture and urban farming. The Fibonacci Sequence has deep roots throughout the history of mathematics and computer science. Outside of mathematics and computer science, the Fibonacci Sequence is found throughout nature and is embedded in many interesting pop-culture topics including finance, architecture, cinema, comic strips, human development, literature, music, visual arts, and television. Finally, the hop plant is a perfect example of Fibonacci occurring in nature and it&rsquo;s also what we love to put in our beer!</p>
