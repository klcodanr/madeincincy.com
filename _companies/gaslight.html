<p>Many organizations struggle to allocate people across projects, leading to churn and poor utilization. Three Cincinnati-based entrepreneurs founded Essomenic Systems as we saw a need for a better way to run people-based businesses.</p>
<p>Our software helps you best allocate the people in your company. We do this by providing a holistic view and deep insights on the people and work going on within the company.</p>
