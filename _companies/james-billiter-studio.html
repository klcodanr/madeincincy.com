James Billiter is a Cincinnati native who combines his passions for Graphic Design and History into unique art prints and branding projects. He started Billiter Studio to pursue his love for custom typography, pattern and illustration. Inspired by Art History, Billiter Studio takes an “applied art” approach to design: once a concept is developed for an audience, Billiter brings these ideas to life through hand-crafted methods. Billiter uses his experience in printmaking, sign painting, ceramics and sculpture to capture his interests in subjects such as architecture, nature, cycling, music, and beer brewing.
