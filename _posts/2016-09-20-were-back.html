<p>
    After a long hiatus, Made in Cincy is back up and running!
</p>
<p>
    We attempted to migrate all of the old content onto the new platform, however a good deal was not recoverable so make sure you review your profile, company, project, group or event and ensure that it's correct and up to date.
</p>
<p>
    If you find something missing or incorrect you can request it to be added by clicking on the green edit buttons on the pages. Simply fill out the form and we'll get right on updating the page.
</p>
<p>
    Just in case you are curious, here are a few questions you might have:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>What happened?</dt>
    <dd>The software running the old site, Citizenry, was not maintained and started causing major issues.</dd>
    <dt>What is this site running on now?</dt>
    <dd>It's a static website created by a tool called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and running on the <a href="http://github.com">GitHub Pages</a> platform.</dd>
    <dt>Why are some of the images small?</dt>
    <dd>We recovered the old content off the internet archive. Some pages weren't cached so so we had to pull just the info of the listing page. If you'd like to provide better images and descriptions, please edit the page.</dd>
    <dt>Why is some of my profile missing?</dt>
    <dd>See above.</dd>
    <dt>I have another question!</dt>

<h3>Happy Making!</h3>
