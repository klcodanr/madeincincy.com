<p>
The INKUBATOR aims to increase the competitive advantage for NKU students by providing them with education, mentoring, financing, facilities, and other related resources necessary for a successful entrepreneurial startup process. The main function of The INKUBATOR will be to act as a “feeder system” to area accelerators and technology parks like the eZone, Brandery, HCBC, cincytech, bioLOGIC, Vora Technology Park, etc. We intend to do this by helping facilitate the idea-to-opportunity transition process and to produce viable opportunities that graduate from the program. In addition to soft services, The INKUBATOR will provide teams with access to space, business services, equipment, and financing necessary for opportunity growth.
