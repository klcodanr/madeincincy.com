<p>&bull; me: UX &amp; Service Designer passionate about design, technology, collaboration and when all of these come together.</p>
<p>&bull; location: Currently in San Francisco, but looking to relocate to Cincinnati once I've found work - open to a variety of opportunities, so contact me.</p>
<p>&bull; fun stuff: Looking forward to connecting with geeks, creatives and interesting folks in Cinci.&nbsp;<br />Also every city should have a 'madeincincy.com' equivalent. ;)</p>
